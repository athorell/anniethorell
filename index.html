          My name is Annie Thorell

        <div>
          I'm a frontend engineer skilled in product management, UX and UI.
          I get really excited about well executed visions, great products (in any area) and the
          motivation we as human beings find in our work. Iâ€™m a highly analytical person who can
          navigate both business, tech and user needs in my problem solving and prioritization.
          <span class="highlight">My super power is my ability to find structure in chaos</span>
          and use a common set of rules or goals to navigate the road ahead.
