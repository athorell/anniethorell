        <p>
          I’m a developer by heart, but have been seeking the bigger
          picture in everything I've done. I love tech for what it can do
          for its user, and  always put the user front and center in
          my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand how UX, design, code and business have to work in
          symbiosis to deliver great products, and have worked hands on
          with all these crafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I navigate comfortably between long term and short term goals,
          and can balance vision, strategy and hands-on todos.
        </p>
        <p>
          My superpower is my ability to find structure in chaos.

            To understand how to build a product that is successful with the
            user, I look at qualitative and quantitative data. Metrics build a
            picture, talking to a user and understanding the world around
            him/her tell the whole story. Beyond data, I'll use my gut feeling
            to take the product towards it's vision.

            <span class="skill-category">Tech.</span>
            With my developer background, I comfortably navigate technical
            needs and constraints in my prioritisation. I know how to
            leverage tech to take a product to the next level. I understand the needs
            of a tech team, and can have discussions on the right level to find
            the best way forward together.

            <span class="skill-category">Business.</span>
            I have run a business of my own and know how to navigate between
            a spreadsheet and the reality of the product. The
            needs of the business interfer with the product in many
            ways, and I know how to be pragmantic and build with what we’ve got
            while not loosing site of our north star.
